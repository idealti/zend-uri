Creating a New URI with ZendUriUriFactory::factory() // To create a new URI from scratch, pass only the scheme // followed by a colon. $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('http:'); // $uri instanceof Zend\\Uri\\UriInterface To create a new URI from scratch, pass only the scheme followed by a colon to Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory() . If an unsupported scheme is passed and no scheme-specific class is specified, a Zend\\Uri\\Exception\\InvalidArgumentException will be thrown. If the scheme or URI passed is supported, Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory() will return a class implementing Zend\\Uri\\UriInterface that specializes in the scheme referenced. Supported schemes At the time of writing, zend-uri provides built-in support for the following schemes only: HTTP, HTTPS, MAILTO and FILE. Creating a New Custom-Class URI You can specify a custom class to be used when using the Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory by registering your class with the UriFactory using Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::registerScheme($scheme, $class) . This enables you to create your own URI class and instantiate new URI objects based on your own custom classes. The 2nd parameter passed to Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::registerScheme() must be a string with the name of a class implementing Zend\\Uri\\UriInterface . The class must either be already loaded, or be loadable by the autoloader. Creating a URI using a custom class The following registers the ftp scheme with a custom URI class: use MyNamespace\\MyClass; use Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory UriFactory::registerScheme('ftp', MyClass::class); $ftpUri = UriFactory::factory( 'ftp://user@ftp.example.com/path/file' ); // $ftpUri is an instance of MyLibrary\\MyClass, which implements // Zend\\Uri\\UriInterface Manipulating an Existing URI To manipulate an existing URI, pass the entire URI as a string to Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory() , and then manipulate the instance returned. Manipulating an Existing URI with Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory() use Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory; // To manipulate an existing URI, pass it in. $uri = UriFactory::factory('http://www.zend.com'); // $uri instanceof Zend\\Uri\\UriInterface The URI will be parsed and validated. If it is found to be invalid, a Zend\\Uri\\Exception\\InvalidArgumentException will be thrown immediately. Otherwise, Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory() will return a class implementing Zend\\Uri\\UriInterface that specializes in the scheme to be manipulated. Common Instance Methods The Zend\\Uri\\UriInterface defines several instance methods that are useful for working with any kind of URI. Getting the Scheme of the URI The scheme of the URI is the part of the URI that precedes the colon. For example, the scheme of http://johndoe@example.com/my/path?query#token is 'http'. $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('mailto:john.doe@example.com'); $scheme = $uri->getScheme(); // \"mailto\" The getScheme() instance method returns only the scheme part of the URI object (not the separator). Getting the Userinfo of the URI The userinfo of the URI is the optional part of the URI that follows the colon and comes before the host-part. For example, the userinfo of http://johndoe@example.com/my/path?query#token is 'johndoe'. $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('mailto:john.doe@example.com'); $scheme = $uri->getUserinfo(); // \"john.doe\" The getUserinfo() method returns only the userinfo part of the URI object. Getting the host of the URI The host of the URI is the optional part of the URI that follows the user-part and comes before the path-part. For example, the host of http://johndoe@example.com/my/path?query#token is 'example.com'. $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('mailto:john.doe@example.com'); $scheme = $uri->getHost(); // \"example.com\" The getHost() method returns only the host part of the URI object. Host is case insensitive Per IETF 3986 Section 3.2.2 , the host segment of a URL is considered case insensitive. As such, starting in version 2.7.0, we now cast the hostname to lowercase, and getHost() will always return a lowercase representation. Getting the port of the URI The port of the URI is the optional part of the URI that follows the host-part and comes before the path-part. For example, the host of http://johndoe@example.com:80/my/path?query#token is '80'. $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('http://example.com:8080'); $scheme = $uri->getPort(); // \"8080\" Concrete URI instances can define default ports that can be returned when no port is given in the URI: $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('http://example.com'); $scheme = $uri->getPort(); // \"80\" The getHost() method returns only the port part of the URI object. Getting the path of the URI The path of the URI is a mandatory part of the URI that follows the port and comes before the query-part. For example, the path of http://johndoe@example.com:80/my/path?query#token is '/my/path'. $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('http://example.com:80/my/path?a=b&c=d#token'); $scheme = $uri->getPath(); // \"/my/path\" The getPath() method returns only the path of the URI object. Getting the query-part of the URI The query-part of the URI is an optional part of the URI that follows the path and comes before the fragment. For example, the query of http://johndoe@example.com:80/my/path?query#token is 'query'. $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('http://example.com:80/my/path?a=b&c=d#token'); $scheme = $uri->getQuery(); // \"a=b&c=d\" The getQuery() method returns only the query-part of the URI object. The query string often contains key=value pairs and therefore can be split into an associative array. This array can be retrieved using getQueryAsArray() : $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('http://example.com:80/my/path?a=b&c=d#token'); $scheme = $uri->getQueryAsArray(); // [ // 'a' => 'b', // 'c' => 'd', // ] Getting the fragment-part of the URI The fragment-part of the URI is an optional part of the URI that follows the query. For example, the fragment of http://johndoe@example.com:80/my/path?query#token is 'token'. $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('http://example.com:80/my/path?a=b&c=d#token'); $scheme = $uri->getFragment(); // \"token\" The getFragment() method returns only the fragment-part of the URI object. Getting the Entire URI The toString() method returns the string representation of the entire URI . $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('http://www.zend.com'); echo $uri->toString(); // \"http://www.zend.com\" // Alternate method: echo (string) $uri; // \"http://www.zend.com\" The Zend\\Uri\\UriInterface defines also the magic __toString() method that returns the string representation of the URI when the object is cast to a string. Validating the URI When using Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory() , the given URI will always be validated and a Zend\\Uri\\Exception\\InvalidArgumentException will be thrown when the URI is invalid. However, after the Zend\\Uri\\UriInterface is instantiated for a new URI or an existing valid one, it is possible that the URI can later become invalid after it is manipulated. $uri = Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory('http://www.zend.com'); $isValid = $uri->isValid(); // TRUE The isValid() instance method provides a means to check that the URI object is still valid.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#creating-a-new-uri","text":"Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory will build a new URI from scratch if only a scheme is passed to Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory() .","title":"Creating a New URI"},{"location":"usage/#manipulating-an-existing-uri","text":"To manipulate an existing URI, pass the entire URI as a string to Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory() , and then manipulate the instance returned.","title":"Manipulating an Existing URI"},{"location":"usage/#common-instance-methods","text":"The Zend\\Uri\\UriInterface defines several instance methods that are useful for working with any kind of URI.","title":"Common Instance Methods"},{"location":"usage/#validating-the-uri","text":"When using Zend\\Uri\\UriFactory::factory() , the given URI will always be validated and a Zend\\Uri\\Exception\\InvalidArgumentException will be thrown when the URI is invalid.
